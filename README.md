# twitch-channel <!-- omit in toc -->

A small library to listen to various events that can happen on a twitch channel (chat messages, raids, follows, subscriptionsâ€¦)

This library acts as a layer on top of various twitch APIs (currently: IRC and EventSub) so you only have to interact with a single EventEmitter that emits uniform events.

The event objects are kept simple and without surprises.
